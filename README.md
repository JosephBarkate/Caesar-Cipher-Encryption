# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption
Program that reads a text file and can either encrypt or decrypt

OOP Utilized

To encrypt a story: "encrypt_story("plainStory.txt",5)" 

#where the text file is the first argument and the second argument is the number of shifts

to decrypt a story : decrypt_story("story.txt")  

#Where the input story is the text argument.  Notice how there is no shift number, that is because the program will use a Cipher algorithm to decrypt any message that uses Caesar-Cipher-Encryption.

Test cases are included at the bottom of the code.
